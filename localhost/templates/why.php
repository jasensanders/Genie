<h2> Why would this be useful?</h2>
<p>Really, I built this tool for me. Before this tool I still collided concepts and searched the web for them, but did so manually and much more slowly.  What this site attempts to do is simulate and extend imagination. What it actually does is very simple and yet it's results can be very profund. 
 Imagnination is the best thing about being human. However much of the really great imagining that your brain does happens while you sleep.  
 With this tool you can perform a similar function to what happens in your brain while you are awake. Because there are a fixed number of words and as such known concepts it is possible to enumerate all
 combinations of specific concepts without having the computer sort them.  Cause that would be no fun. Honestly I have no idea what you will learn, but i know that you will learn something and it is usually unexpected.</p>

<h3> Thought extender theory: </h3>
<p><strong>1. All concepts are carried as words.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>2. There are a fixed number of words</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Therefore there are a fixed number of known concepts. Although this number grows daily and is very high. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. All things that are known to exist have most likely been refrenced on the internet somwhere. Or will be when they are created.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Most search engines employ very good algorithms for making sense of what is typed in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5. It is then concievably possible to use a computer program to collide concepts and use the internet itself as the filter for what is nonsense. </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Your brain is better at pattern recognition and concept association than the computer is. </strong></p>
<p><strong>7. By combining a computer for its speed, the internet for its data and algorithms and you for your pattern recongnition it is possible to speed up innovation significantly.  </strong></p>
<h3> Go ahead. Have fun! </h3>
